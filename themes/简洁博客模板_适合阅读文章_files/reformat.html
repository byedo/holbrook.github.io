        <p>Earlier I looked at PE ratios as a factor (<a href="http://www.eickonomics.com/posts/2013-11-26-pe-ratio-factor-backtest-statistics-review/" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong><sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[1]</sup></a>). Another well known and simple factor supported by academic research is to buy companies that have performed the best over the last 52 weeks or as part of a long/short strategy. </p>

<p>I performed a factor backtest on 52 week total returns using the parameters below and took a closer look at the statistical properties of the strategy. </p>

<h4 id="parameters">Parameters</h4>
<p><b>Period of Test:</b> 1999-01-02 to 2013-12-31 <br>
<b>Re-balancing Frequency:</b> Monthly <br>
<b>Ranking Method:</b> Percentile into 5 buckets (0 to 20% (Lowest 52 week return), 20% to 40%, etc) <br>
<b>Stock Universe:</b> Russell 3000 <br>
<b>Factor:</b> Trailing 52 Week Returns </p>

<p>Additionally, the long/short strategy is created by going long the stocks with highest 52 week returns (80 to 100) and going short the lowest 52 week returns (0 to 20). </p>

<h4 id="annualized-return-statistics">Annualized Return Statistics</h4>

<p>As expected, overall the top quantile of companies continued to outperform (12.05% annualized vs 3.21% annualized for the Russell 3000). Surprisingly, the overall long/short strategy did not perform very well as it’s performance was very weak coming off the market bottoms in 2003 and 2009, eliminating any positive returns generated in other years. </p>

</div>
</div>

<h4 id="cumulative-return">Cumulative Return</h4>
<p>On a cumulative and rolling basis the top performers outperform other quantile’s but the weakest quantile outperforms significantly coming off the bottoms of a bear market. This weak quantile out-performance post bear market can lead to a very poor period for a 52 week return long/short strategy. </p>

<p>Where the long/short strategy does outperform is during a market downturn, as seen in strong performances by the strategy from 2000 to 2003 and 2008. </p>

<p>Looking at the overall risk metrics for the various strategies the 60 to 80% quantile shows the least volatile monthly returns. While again the long/short strategy has significant downside and max drawdown risk characteristics due to it’s performance in 2003 and 2009. </p>

<h4 id="overall-remarks">Overall Remarks</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Overall, those companies which performed the best over the last year are likely to continue to outperform over the next month. </li>
  <li>During a market correction a long/short strategy based on 1 year returns is negatively correlated to the market, providing a hedge and will likely outperform. </li>
  <li>As you come out of a bear market, the best performers in the previous year will under-perform (significantly in ‘09 case) those that performed the weakest. Additionally, continuing to allocate capital to a long/short 1 year return strategy immediately following a bear market can be very damaging to your portfolio. </li>

During installation of the Software and from time to time thereafter when Licensee uses the Software, the Software will send information about the Software and the Individual Computer on which the Software is installed to Evernote. This information includes the version of the Software, the language of the Software (e.g., English, Japanese, etc.), the Internet protocol address of the Individual Computer and the Individual Computer's hardware configuration.

Depending upon the settings in the Software, updates to the Software may be installed automatically without Licensee's separate consent. In addition, Evernote will use the information provided to Evernote to enable interaction of the Individual Computer with the Evernote Service, if Licensee is a Registered User.

Evernote will use digital certificates to confirm Licensee's identity for the purpose of enabling standard encryption of content transmitted between Licensee's Individual Computer and the Evernote Service. In an effort to protect the security of such transmissions, Licensee cannot disable the use of such digital certificates in connection with the use of the Evernote Service. By using the Software, Licensee consents to the sharing of the information and interactions described herein and, by using the Software with the Evernote Service, Licensee also consents to the use of information described in the then current Evernote Privacy Policy published at the Evernote Site.</p><h2>5. TERM AND TERMINATION.</h2><p>This Agreement shall commence on the earlier date of delivery or download of the Software, shall be confirmed upon and by the installation of the Software on any computer device and shall continue for so long as Licensee complies with the terms herein, subject to termination or expiration in accordance with the terms provided herein.

Upon the termination of this Agreement, all licenses and other rights granted to Licensee hereunder shall immediately terminate. Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the provisions of Sections 3 (Ownership of Software), 6.2 (Disclaimer of Warranties), 7 (Limitations on Liability), 11 (General Provisions) and this Section 5 shall survive and continue to be legally binding upon Licensee and Evernote.</p><h2>6. SOFTWARE WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES; SOFTWARE WARRANTY REMEDY.</h2><h3>6.1 Limited Warranty.</h3><p>Evernote hereby warrants to Licensee that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the functional description applicable thereto at the Evernote Site if used in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and any applicable directions or requirements in the Documentation. The foregoing warranty is extended to the initial Licensee only, is not transferable and shall be in effect for thirty (30) days immediately following Licensee's receipt of the Software (the "Software Warranty Period"). Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy and the entire liability of Evernote and its suppliers and licensors for any breach of this limited warranty will be, at Evernote's option, repair or replacement of the Software, if such breach is reported prior to the expiration of the Warranty Period to Evernote or the Evernote authorized distributor that supplied the Software to Licensee (the "Software Warranty Remedy"). Evernote may require that Licensee return or certify the destruction of all copies of the Software to Evernote or to the authorized distributor in order to receive the designated remedy hereunder. Any replacement Software provided pursuant to this Section 6.1 will be covered by the warranty in this Section 6.1 for the remainder of the original Software Warranty Period or for 30 days from the date on which Licensee receives such repaired or replacement Software, whichever is longer.</p><h3>6.2 Disclaimer of Warranties.</h3><p>(a) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTION 6.1, THE SOFTWARE IS BEING PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND AND EVERNOTE HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES AS TO THE CONDITION, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, DESIGN, OPERATION OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY EVERNOTE, ITS RESELLERS AND/OR ITS OR THEIR AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES, SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE OR MODIFY THE SCOPE OF THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN. If Licensee's legal jurisdiction provides that a certain implied warranty may not be disclaimed, such implied warranty shall only apply to defects discovered during the period of the express Software Warranty Period provided herein. There is no implied warranty for defects discovered after the expiration of such Software Warranty Period. Some legal jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so these limitations may not apply to Licensee.</p><p>(b) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTION 6.1, EVERNOTE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET ALL REQUIREMENTS OF LICENSEE, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT ALL SOFTWARE DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED. FURTHER, EVERNOTE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DEFECT OR ERROR RESULTING FROM: (I) THE MODIFICATION, MISUSE OR DAMAGE OF THE SOFTWARE BY PARTIES OTHER THAN EVERNOTE OR PARTIES PERFORMING AS A CONTRACTOR TO, AND AT THE DIRECTION OF, EVERNOTE, (II) LICENSEE'S FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT ALL BUG FIXES OR OTHER DEFECT CORRECTIONS WHICH ARE MADE AVAILABLE BY EVERNOTE, (III) USE OF THE SOFTWARE IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH THE DIRECTIONS PROVIDED IN THE DOCUMENTATION OR AS PERMITTED BY THIS AGREEMENT, (IV) ANY COMPUTER VIRUS OR (V) ANY DEFECT IN OR FAILURE OF ANY THIRD PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL COMPUTER, EQUIPMENT, NETWORK OR SOFTWARE, OR FOR ANY USER ERROR. EVERNOTE DOES NOT WARRANT AND SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO NON-EVERNOTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE, INTERNET CONNECTIONS OR CONNECTIVITY OR COMPUTER NETWORKS.</p><h2>7.

IN CONSIDERATION FOR, AND AS A FUNDAMENTAL AND EXPRESS CONDITION OF ENABLING USE OF THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT CHARGE, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, EVERNOTE SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT THE SOFTWARE WARRANTY REMEDY. THE LIMITATIONS HEREIN SHALL APPLY EVEN IF THE SOFTWARE WARRANTY REMEDY DOES NOT FULLY COMPENSATE LICENSEE FOR ANY OR ALL LOSSES, OR IF EVERNOTE KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. SOME LEGAL JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE IF LICENSEE RESIDES IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS.</p><h2>8.
